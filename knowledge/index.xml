    <description>This is my repository of thoughts and learnings. A small subset of what I write in my Obsidian vault gets published here. At the moment, all the published content is about my Homelab: a self-hosting experiment to enjoy the IT services I need – for free and with full control – and, more importantly, to hack around and learn about IT infrastructure and related topics.</description>

    <guid>https://one137.dev/knowledge/Homelab/Public-website/Serve-static-files-through-NPM</guid>
    <description> Add Proxy Host one137.dev → http://STATIC_FILES:1 (name doesn’t matter) Activate Block Exploits and SSL as usual Note Access rules are not applied. If needed, they should go in the advanced tab under location /, for example (IPs should match those in Create Access List): allow 192.168.1.1/24; allow ip-of-wg-easy/32; allow ip-of-cloudflared/32; deny all; In Advanced tab, add (see Setup NPM for the logs, and X is the proxy number): location / { root /data/nginx/custom/one137-web; try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404; access_log /data/logs/proxy-host-X_access.log default_plus_cf; # for fail2ban } Create static web files in dockerhost’s /srv/docker/volumes/one137-web bind /srv/docker/volumes/one137-web:/srv/docker/volumes/one137-web in NPM’s stack on dockerhost: sudo -u dockeruser ln -s /srv/docker/volumes/one137-web /srv/docker/volumes/npm/data/nginx/custom/one137-web See Continuous Delivery for automation.</description>

    <guid>https://one137.dev/knowledge/Homelab/Services/Pi-Hole</guid>
    <description>Pi-Hole serves as a local DNS server. In particular, it acts as a DNS sinkhole to provide network-level ad and tracker blocking. It works by intercepting DNS requests from all devices on the network and blocking requests to known advertising and tracking domains, effectively stopping ads before they’re even downloaded.</description>
