    <title>Pi-Hole</title>

    <description>Pi-Hole serves as a local DNS server. In particular, it acts as a DNS sinkhole to provide network-level ad and tracker blocking. It works by intercepting DNS requests from all devices on the network and blocking requests to known advertising and tracking domains, effectively stopping ads before they’re even downloaded.</description>
